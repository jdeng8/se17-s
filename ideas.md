#Here we can put in some ideas

* A tool to transfer music playlists between music services (that is free)
    - Some tools exist already that cost money
* A chit tracking tools for students working on projects in software engineering
* Finding parking in downtown Raleigh
* unsearchable PDFs that are typed
* building software on across OS platforms
* git explanation and tutorial
* latex tool that works with google drive.
* URL shortener that works with arbitrary addresses (your website rather than tiny.cc)

* tool to post slack messages as github issues
